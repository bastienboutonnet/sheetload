# sheetwork 💩🤦

A handy package to load Google Sheets to your database right from the CLI and with easy configuration via YAML files.

> ⚠️ **warning** `sheetwork` is still in its early inception (don't get fooled by the 1 in the version). Please do some testing before you end up using it in production, and feel free to report bugs.

> **compatibility**: 
> - Python >=3.7, Mac OSX >10.14. 
> - Probably works on most UNIX systems but not nested. Most likely absolutely not working in Windows.
