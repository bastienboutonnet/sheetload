Boolean data-type casting was buggy somewhere between ``v1.0.0`` and ``v1.0.2`` and resulted to all non null strings to be given a ``True`` value. We now handle boolean conversion explicitly by mapping strings ``false`` and ``true`` to python ``False`` and ``True`` that pandas can actually understand and expose to the database appropriately. **NOTE**: If the user asks for a column to be cast to boolean but this column contains any other string than the aforementioned ones (and capitalised
variants) ``sheetwork`` will throw a ``ColumnNotBooleanCompatibleError`` that will help the user locate the offending column as well as the offending value(s).
